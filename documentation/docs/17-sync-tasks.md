| priority *Integer* | The priority of the task (a number between `1` and `4`, `4` for very urgent and `1` for natural). <br>**Note**: Keep in mind that `very urgent` is the priority 1 on clients. So, `p1` will return `4` in the API. |

|----------|----------|-------------|
| id *String* | Yes | Task ID to complete. |

}
```

This command is used to uncomplete and restore an completed task.

Any ancestor items or sections will also be reinstated. Items will have the `checked` value reset.

The reinstated items and sections will appear at the end of the list within their parent, after any previously active tasks.

### Command arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| id *String* | Yes | Task ID to uncomplete |

## Complete a recurring task

> Example complete recurring task request:

```shell
$ curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567" \
    -d commands='[
    {
        "type": "item_update_date_complete",
        "uuid": "c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab",
        "args": {
            "id": "2995104339",
            "due": {"date": "2014-10-30", "string": "every day"},
            "is_forward": 1,
            "reset_subtasks": 0
        }
    }]'
```

> Example response:

```shell
{
  ...
  "sync_status": {"c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab": "ok"},
  ...
}
```

Complete a recurring task. The reason why this is a special case is because we need to mark a recurring completion (and using `item_update` won't do this). See also `item_close` for a simplified version of the command.

### Command arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| id *String* | Yes | The ID of the item to update (a number or a temp id). |
| due *Object* | No | The due date of the task. See the [Due dates](#tag/Due-dates) section for more details. |
| is_forward *Boolean* | No | Set this argument to 1 for completion, or 0 for uncompletion (e.g., via undo). By default, this argument is set to 1 (completion). |
| reset_subtasks *Boolean* | No | Set this property to 1 to reset subtasks when a recurring task is completed. By default, this property is not set (0), and subtasks will retain their existing status when the parent task recurs. |

## Close task

> Example close task request:

```shell
$ curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567" \
    -d commands='[
    {
        "type": "item_close",
        "uuid": "c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab",
        "args": {"id": "2995104339"}
    }]'
```

> Example response:

```shell
{
  ...
  "sync_status": {"c5888360-96b1-46be-aaac-b49b1135feab": "ok"},
  ...
}
```

A simplified version of `item_complete` / `item_update_date_complete`. The command does exactly what official clients do when you close a task: regular tasks are completed and moved to the archive, recurring tasks are scheduled to their next occurrence.

### Command arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| id *String* | Yes | The ID of the item to close (a number or a temp id). |

## Update day orders

> Example update day orders request:

```shell
$ curl https://api.todoist.com/api/v1/sync \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567" \
    -d commands='[

  "sync_status": {"dbeb40fc-905f-4d8a-8bae-547d3bbd6e91": "ok"},
  ...
}
```

Update the day orders of multiple tasks at once.

### Command arguments

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| ids_to_orders *Object* | Yes | A dictionary, where a task `id` is the key, and the `day_order` value: `item_id: day_order`. |
