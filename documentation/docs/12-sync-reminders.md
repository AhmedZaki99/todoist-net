> An example reminder:

```json
{
  "id": "6X7Vfq5rqPMM5j5q",
  "notify_uid": "2671355",
  "item_id": "6RP2hmPwM3q4WGfW",
  "type": "absolute",

*Availability of reminders functionality and the maximum number of stored reminders are dependent on the current user plan. These values are indicated by the `reminders`, `max_reminders_time` and `max_reminders_location` properties of the [user plan limits](#tag/Sync/User/User-plan-limits) object.*
