# Project View Options Defaults

Project View Options Defaults (PVODs) define the default view preferences for all users of a project. These settings serve as the baseline view configuration that applies to all project members unless they have their own personal view options set.

> An example Project View Options Default object:

```json
{
    "project_id": "2203306141",
    "view_mode": "list",
    "grouped_by": null,
    "sorted_by": "due_date",
    "sort_order": "asc",
    "show_completed_tasks": false,
    "filtered_by": null,
    "calendar_settings": null,
    "creator_uid": 1855589,
    "updater_uid": 1855589
}
```

## Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| project_id | The project ID these defaults apply to (string, required) |
| view_mode | The default view mode: `list`, `board`, or `calendar` (string, required) |
| grouped_by | How tasks are grouped: `due_date`, `created_at`, `label`, `assignee`, `priority`, or `project` (string or null) |
| sorted_by | How tasks are sorted: `due_date`, `created_at`, `task_order`, `assignee`, `alphabetically`, or `priority` (string or null) |
| sort_order | Sort direction: `asc` or `desc` (string, required) |
| show_completed_tasks | Whether to show completed tasks by default (boolean, required) |
| filtered_by | JSON string with filter criteria (string or null) |
| calendar_settings | Calendar-specific settings when `view_mode` is `calendar` (object or null) |
| creator_uid | User ID who created these defaults (integer, required) |
| updater_uid | User ID who last updated these defaults (integer, required) |

## Sync Behavior

- PVODs are returned during full sync if the user has access to the project
- When a project is created, its PVOD is automatically created and included in the same sync response
- Updates to PVODs trigger sync events for all project members
- When a PVOD is deleted, a tombstone is returned with `is_deleted: true` and includes: `project_id`, `is_deleted`, `creator_uid`, `updater_uid`, `show_completed_tasks`, and all view option fields (`view_mode`, `grouped_by`, `sorted_by`, `sort_order`, `filtered_by`) set to empty strings. `calendar_settings` is set to `null`
- PVODs take precedence over legacy `project.view_style` settings
